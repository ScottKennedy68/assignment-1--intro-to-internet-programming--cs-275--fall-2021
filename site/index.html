    <h1> Ten Principles for Good Design </h1>
    <h2> by Dieter Rams </h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Good design is innovative. The possibilities for progression are not, by any means,
    exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities
    for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with
    improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

    <p> Good design makes a product useful. A product is bought to be used.
    It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic
    criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst
    disregarding anything that could detract from it. </p>
